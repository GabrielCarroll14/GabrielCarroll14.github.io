My dev portfolio site!

This is my simple developer portfolio side that I build for me to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.

If there is anything you can find that is wrong with the site, leave a issue on GitHub. Or, even better, fix the issue yourself then create a pull request with the updated changes ready for me to merge.
