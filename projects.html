    <!--Dynamo bot-->
    <section>
        <h2>DynamoBot (Python)</h2>
        <p>DynamoBot is a Discord bot I built using the discord.py module. ✌️</p>
        <p>It has all the basic features as a normal discord bot such as content moderation and the ability to ban rule breakers. 👍 </p>
        <p>I also added the ability to play my Python app PySlots in it. 😊</p>
        <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1199993493553164359&permissions=8&scope=bot" style="color: blue;">Try it here!</a>

    <!--WatchSlots-->
    <section>
        <h2>WatchSlots (SwiftUI)</h2>
        <p>WatchSlots is a apple watch slot machine app. The idea was brought from my Python app PySlots. ✌️</p>
        <p>As my Mac only runs Xcode 14 I was unable to publish this on the app store. 😢</p>

    <!--Website-->
    <section>
        <h2>This website! (HTML, CSS)</h2>
        <p>This is the website you are currently on. This is the first bit of webdev I have done so far I a have really enjoyed doing it. 😁</p>
        <p>As I am still learning web development, this website will be a little rough to start of. 👍</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/GabrielCarroll14/GabrielCarroll14.github.io" style="color: blue;">GitHub repo here!</a>

    <section>
        <h2>An algorithm to help detect Cancer (Python, PyTorch)</h2>
        <p>I build this as my first project in PyTorch and supprisingly it actually worked! 😊</p>
        <p>I have decided not to make this a public GitHub repo as the model isn't fully accurate. 😎</p>
