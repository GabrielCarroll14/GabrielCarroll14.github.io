        <h2>DynamoBot (Python)</h2>
        <p>DynamoBot is a Discord bot I built using the discord.py module. ✌️</p>
        <p>It has all the basic features as a normal discord bot such as content moderation and the ability to ban rule breakers. 👍 </p>
        <p>I also added the ability to play my Python app PySlots in it. 😊</p>

        <h2>WatchSlots (SwiftUI)</h2>
        <p>WatchSlots is a apple watch slot machine app. The idea was brought from my Python app PySlots. ✌️</p>
        <p>As my Mac only runs Xcode 14 I was unable to publish this on the app store. 😢</p>

        <h2>This website! (HTML, CSS)</h2>
        <p>This is the website you are currently on. This is the first bit of webdev I have done so far I a have really enjoyed doing it. 😁</p>
        <p>As I am still learning web development, this website will be a little rough to start of. 👍</p>
